## Week 11, extra credit

This is an optional extra credit assignment. You can do it any time during the rest of the semester. 

If you complete all ten problems, you will get 4 points added to a homework assignment. 

Do it alone, and don't discuss it with anyone who hasn't done it yet. Use your page of rules. Don't guess!
