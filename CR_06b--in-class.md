## assignment 07a (meeting)

---

Create a proof for an argument in the space below. Use at least three different rules. Do this with your group, but everyone in your group should have a different proof with (ideally) some variation among the rules used.

---

Begin by listing a premise or some premises, and then work to the conclusion. When you are finished, if the proof is complete and correct, every line will have a `+` at the far right and Carnap will display the premises and conclusion above your proof (but that box won't turn green). **Your argument has to be valid, and to be valid, every line of the proof has to have a `+`.**

---

When you're done, take a photo or a screenshot of your proof and submit it on Canvas ("(Carnap) proofs, assignment 7a, (meeting)"). In the space for comments, list the other members of your group and the rules that they used like this:

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Abby: &E, vE, &I<br>
Dave: ->E, &E, vI<br>
Carol: ... <br></p>
