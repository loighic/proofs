## playground

If you want to do a proof for an argument that hasn't been assigned, you can do it here. 

Begin by listing the premise or premises, and then work to the conclusion. When you are finished, if the proof is complete and correct, every line will have a "+" at the far right and Carnap will display the premises and conclusion above your proof (but that box won't turn green).

If you are doing multiple proofs, then just refresh the page after each one to clear the "playground."
