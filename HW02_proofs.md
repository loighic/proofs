## proofs HW 2

Each problem is worth 10 points, and the whole assignment is worth 100 points. Problems that are submitted late will receive 9 points. Your grade will be put on a 10 point scale when it is posted in Canvas.

For 2.1 - 2.5, you need to use the same rules as you used in HW 1, but each proof requires multiple steps (and so multiple applications of one or more of the rules). See sections 14.2 and 14.6 for some examples. 

~~~{.ProofChecker .JohnsonSL options="fonts tabindent render" guides="fitch" points="10" late-credit="9"}
2.1 (P & ~Q) & R :|-: P 
2.2 M :|-: (M v N) v Q
2.3 ((R & T) & S) & ~Q :|-: R
2.4 ~R & T :|-: ~R v S
~~~

For 2.5, five of these sentences go on the lines following the premises (and not necessarily in this order): 

Q, &not;T, P, (Q & &not;T), (R &rarr; &not;T), (R & &not;T), (&not;S & Q).

2.5 (R & ~T) & (~S & Q) :|-: Q & ~T 
~~~

To do 2.7 - 2.10, see the subsection of 14.3 titled "Double negation."

2.6 M v N, ~M :|-: N
2.7 P :|-: ~~P
2.8 ~~Q :|-: Q
2.9 ~P v Q, P :|-: Q
2.10 R v ~T, T :|-: R
