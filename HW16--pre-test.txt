## HW 16

This is preparation for test 3, but it should not be the only preparation that you do.

Carnap will not provide feedback while you are doing these proofs (either at the end of each line or when the proof is complete), and they can be submitted even if they are incomplete or incorrect. 

Each problem is worth 1 point, there are 16 problems, and the maximum score is 10. You can do all 16 problems, and if you get them all correct, Carnap will record 16 points, but 10/10 will be recorded in Canvas. If you get, say, 12/16 or 13/16 here, then, again, 10/10 will be recorded in Canvas. If you get 8/16, then 8/10 will be recorded in Canvas.
