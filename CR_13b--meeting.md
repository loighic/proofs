## assignment 14a (meeting)

---

Come up with your own argument, and create a proof for it in the space below. Use at least three different rules and one of these premises:

(P &or; Q) &rarr; (S & &not;T)
(T & Q) v ~(S v R)
(M & T) &harr; (&not;P &or; W)
(S &or; &not;Q) &rarr; (M & W) 

Only use one of these premises. You can add whatever other premises you want. Everyone in your group should select a different premise from this set. 

Do this with your group, but everyone in your group should have a different proof.

Begin by listing the premise or premises, and then work to the conclusion. When you are finished, if the proof is complete and correct, every line will have a `+` at the far right and Carnap will display the premises and conclusion above your proof (but that box won't turn green). **Your argument has to be valid, and the proof has to be correct.**

When you're done, take a photo or a screenshot of your proof and submit it on Canvas ("(Carnap) proofs, assignment 14a, (meeting)"). In the space for comments, list the other members of your group and the premise from the set above that they used.
