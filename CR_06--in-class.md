7.1 ~S v (P -> T), (S & P) :|-: T
7.2 ~P, (R v ~P) <-> (P v Q) :|-: Q
7.3  R, ~(R & S) v (Q -> W), Q & S :|-: W
7.4 N & ~G, (J -> T) <-> K, (K v G) & J :|-: ~G & T
~~~

For 7.5, list the premise as you normally do. On line 2, hit tab and then put the assumption. Hit tab again and put `:AS`. 

As long as you are working in the sub-proof, continue to hit tab before you put the TFL sentence. All of the rules that you already know can be used inside the sub-proof.
