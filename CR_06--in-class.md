6.1 ~S v (P -> T), (S & P) :|-: T
6.2 ~P, (R v ~P) <-> (P v Q) :|-: Q
6.3  R, ~(R & S) v (Q -> W), Q & S :|-: W
6.4 N & ~G, (J -> T) <-> K, (K v G) & J :|-: ~G & T
~~~

For 6.5, list the premise as you normally do. On line 2, hit tab and put the assumption. Hit table again and put `:AS`. As long as you are working in the sub-proof, continue to hit tab before you put the TFL sentence. All of the rules that you already know, can be used in the sub-proof.
