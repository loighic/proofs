10.1 B <-> A, ~(B v C) :|-: ~A
10.2 P->Q, P->~Q :|-: ~P
10.3 P -> Q :|-:  ~(P & ~Q)
~~~

For 10.4, do all of the `&E` and `<->E` that you can before making an assumption for `~E`.

10.4 P <-> (~Q & S), P & (~T -> ~S) :|-: ~Q & T 
~~~

This proof (in 10.5) requires two subproofs. Assume P first (for `->I`) and then ~Q (for `~E`).
